# Hierarchical Attention Networks for Document Classification

- This is my implementation of paper [Hierarchical Attention Networks for Document Classification](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./hovy/papers/16HLT-hierarchical-attention-networks.pdf).

- This implementation was contructed and based on from [repo](https://github.com/uvipen/Hierarchical-attention-networks-pytorch). However, I made this implementation easier to ``train`` and ``inference`` with [AG News Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amananandrai/ag-news-classification-dataset).

- To ``train`` and ``inference``, please download small English vocabulary [glove.6B.50d](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/watts2/glove6b50dtxt) and push it into __data__ folder.
